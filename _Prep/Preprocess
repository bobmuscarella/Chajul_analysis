QUESTIONS
Do functional traits related to variation in growth and mortality during succession?
- Traits are often related to species average growth and survival.
- We know less about how traits mediate demographic response to abiotic conditions.
- During succession of wet tropical forests, light availability rapidly declines
- Species with traits that convey rapid growth in open conditions should be more sensitive to shade
	- Acquisitive species should have a decline in growth and increase in mortality along the successional gradient
	- Conservative species should have less variable growth rates and lower mortality during succession.

Need to include plot age

- Create site census table to tell which census dates were conducted or not in each site so as to assess proper mortality
